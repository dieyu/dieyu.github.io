<br>
On September 1st 1983, when I was born, there was heavy rain, and a huge butterfly on window. So I got the name 刘蝶雨(liú diéyǔ).<br>
<br>
In 2009, I took a new name 刘志勇(liú zhìyǒng).<br>
<br>
A few facts about myself:<br>
I am unable to quit smoking.<br>
I am unable to sleep well.<br>
I am unable to do programming without using Google.<br>
I am unable to do Farmer's Walk if the load is too heavy.<br>
I am unable to speak perfect Mandarin.<br>
